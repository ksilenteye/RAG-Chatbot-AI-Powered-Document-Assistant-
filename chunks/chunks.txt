## 2. Machine Learning Fundamentals
---
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. The core concept behind machine learning is that systems can identify patterns in data and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
---
### 2.1 Types of Machine Learning
---
**Supervised Learning**: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning the input data is paired with the correct output. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so that the model can make predictions on new, unseen data. Common supervised learning

on new, unseen data. Common supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks.

**Unsupervised Learning**: Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The algorithm tries to find hidden patterns or structures in the data without any predefined outputs. Clustering algorithms like K-means and dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are

or penalties. This approach is commonly used in game playing, robotics, and autonomous systems.

### 2.2 Key Concepts in Machine Learning

**Training Data**: The dataset used to train the model. It should be representative of the real-world data the model will encounter.
---
**Validation Data**: A separate dataset used to evaluate the model's performance during training and to tune hyperparameters.

**Test Data**: A final dataset used to assess the model's performance after training is complete.
---
**Overfitting**: When a model learns the training data too well, including noise and irrelevant patterns, leading to poor performance on new data.
---
**Underfitting**: When a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and test data.

## 3. Deep Learning and Neural Networks

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data. Neural networks are inspired by the structure and function of biological neurons in the human brain.
---
### 3.1 Neural Network Architecture

**Input Layer**: The first layer that receives the input data. Each neuron in this layer represents a feature of the input.
---
**Hidden Layers**: Intermediate layers between the input and output layers. These layers perform computations and learn increasingly complex features.

**Output Layer**: The final layer that produces the model's predictions or outputs.
---
**Weights and Biases**: Parameters that the network learns during training. Weights determine the strength of connections between neurons, while biases provide additional flexibility to the model.

### 3.2 Activation Functions
---
### 3.2 Activation Functions

Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns. Common activation functions include:

**ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: f(x) = max(0, x). Most commonly used due to its simplicity and effectiveness.
---
**Sigmoid**: f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x)). Outputs values between 0 and 1, often used in binary classification.

**Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)**: f(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / (e^x + e^(-x)). Outputs values between -1 and 1.
---
**Softmax**: Used in the output layer for multi-class classification, converts outputs to probabilities.

### 3.3 Training Process
---
### 3.3 Training Process

**Forward Propagation**: Input data flows through the network, with each layer computing its output based on the previous layer's output and the current weights and biases.
---
**Loss Function**: Measures the difference between the model's predictions and the actual target values. Common loss functions include mean squared error for regression and cross-entropy for classification.
---
**Backpropagation**: The process of computing gradients of the loss function with respect to the model parameters, allowing the network to update its weights and biases to minimize the loss.
---
**Optimization Algorithms**: Methods used to update the model parameters. Gradient descent and its variants (Adam, RMSprop, etc.) are commonly used.
